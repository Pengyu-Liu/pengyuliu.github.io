This is a blog that records my master project TRAP4vAPP Finding exoplanets in vAPP coronagraphic data at Leiden Observatory 2020-2021.

### Week 7

### 11 Oct 2020

Moved the progress record from the former google sheet to this site. Finished all the steps for one wavelength channel. But the result is not as good as my old method. The planets are not obvious. I tried at least 3 ways to extract star intensity: use the star model, fit the star model(shifted) to the decentered bkg_subtacted images(mean(optimal)=~1.1), fit star model to the aligned bkg_subtacted images and shift(mean(optimal)=1.00...). Also for science frames PCA, I tried masking planets or not when building basis and it seems I should not mask planets(results are different). I fitted the basis to every frame with planets masked. What I have tried today still cannot give a better result than my old way and even worse. There must be something wrong in middle steps. The first picture is my old method and the second is today's result. Debug tomorrow!
