Hi, I'm Pengyu Liu, a master student in Leiden University. I am studying Astronomy and Data Science master program. I'm insterested in many aspects of planets, for example, habitability, atmosphere, formation and evolution. I like novel ideas and am willing to broaden my research fields.

I grew up in Chongqing, a southwest city in China. I used to be crazy about UFO and extraterrestrial life (deceived by some fake books). I like playing football and used to be a member of Peking University women's football team when I was an undergraduate. Economics was also my another interest. I am happy to discuss these topics.
