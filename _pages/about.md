Hi, I'm Pengyu Liu, a master student in Leiden University. My specialization is Astronomy and Data Science. I'm insterested in many aspects of planets, for example, habitability, atmosphere, formation and evolution. I like novel ideas and am willing to broaden my research fields.

I come from Chongqing and like spicy food. I used to be crazy about UFO and extraterrestrial life (now still!). Maybe that's why I fall in love with astronomy. I also love playing football since I was young and used to be a member of Peking University women's football team when I was an undergraduate. Besides, I enjoy gardening and strolling.
