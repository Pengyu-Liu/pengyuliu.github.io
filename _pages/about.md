Hi, I'm Pengyu Liu, a master student in Leiden University. My specialization is Astronomy and Data Science. I'm insterested in many aspects of planets, for example, habitability, atmosphere, formation and evolution. I like novel ideas and am willing to broaden my research fields.

I grew up in Chongqing and my mother tongue is Southwest Mandarin. I used to be crazy about UFO and extraterrestrial life (cheated by some fake books). I like playing football since I was young and used to be a member of Peking University women's football team when I was an undergraduate. Economy was also my another interest (unfinished double major in Bachelor). I am happy to dicuss these topics.
